# LexiForge - Decentralized AI Training Through Human-Powered Paraphrasing

## Background

In the age of AI, the quality of language models depends critically on the training data they receive. Current AI chatbots still struggle with cultural nuances, regional expressions, and linguistic diversity, leading to biased or awkward interactions. Existing dataset generation platforms suffer from centralization issues, poor quality control, and lack of transparency, often exploiting contributors in the process.

The training dataset market is growing rapidly, but the need for high-quality, diverse, and transparently sourced data has never been greater. This is especially true for communities speaking low-resource languages, which remain significantly underrepresented in modern AI systems.

## What is LexiForge

**Our vision:** Create a fair, transparent ecosystem where human language expertise directly shapes the future of AI

**Our mission:** Build the leading decentralized platform for crowdsourced linguistic data, ensuring AI systems understand all languages and cultures with equal proficiency

LexiForge is a decentralized platform where people help train AI by rewriting sentences in different ways. These reworded phrases are reviewed by others, and the best ones are stored securely on the blockchain. This helps make AI chatbots smarter, more accurate, and better at understanding different languages and cultures.

## Why ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)

- Complete decentralization with all services functioning on the blockchain
- Gasless interactions thanks to ICP's reverse gas model - contributors never pay fees
- Horizontal scalability with canister-based architecture
- Enhanced security and transparency through blockchain validation
- Cost-effective infrastructure with computation costs borne by developers, not users

## User Roles & Key Terms

- **Creator:** Lists and sponsors paraphrasing projects that require high-quality linguistic datasets
- **Contributor:** Generates original paraphrases for the sentences listed
- **Validator:** Ensures quality and originality through an 80% consensus approval system
- **LexiTokens:** In-platform rewards earned for verified contributions
- **Project:** A set of requirements established by a Creator that needs crowdsourced paraphrases
- **Task:** A specific sentence that requires paraphrasing in potentially multiple languages

## Core Features

- **Task Creation System:**
  - Custom paraphrasing projects with language options
  - Multilingual support for any language including Hindi, Tamil, French, Swahili, and more
  - Role-based workflow from Creators → Contributors → Validators
  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure:**
  - True decentralization with all data living on-chain
  - Blockchain validation requiring 80% consensus by validators
  - Zero gas fees for contributors through ICP's reverse gas model
  - Transparent contribution tracking with full history available

- **Real-time Analytics:**
  - Live dashboards showing project updates
  - Task completion tracking
  - Contributor statistics and performance metrics

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** ReactJS, ViteJS, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), Juno Build, NanoID
- **Analytics:** Recharts for live dashboards
- **Development Tools:** PostCSS, ESLint, Prettier

## Roadmap

1. **Smart Contracts:** Create canisters for task flow, role logic, and 80% validator consensus
2. **Backend Setup:** Host on ICP, implement NanoID for task IDs, and manage token rewards
3. **Frontend Development:** Build role-based UI with Vite, DaisyUI, and Framer Motion
4. **Integration:** Connect frontend to ICP canisters, enable gasless interactions
5. **Visualization & Testing:** Add Recharts dashboards, test contracts & user flows

## Impact

- **Improved AI Models:** Enhanced linguistic nuance, reduced biases, region-specific customization
- **Transparent Contribution:** Fully traceable crowdsourcing with verifiable rewards
- **Linguistic Inclusion:** Gives voice to underrepresented languages in AI datasets
